# Deployment & Live Site Validation Workflow

## Live Site Information
- **Production URL**: https://jordanlochhill.github.io/prosody.com.au/
- **Local Development**: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
- **Repository**: GitHub Pages deployment from main branch

## Workflow Process
1. **Local Development**: Make changes and test on localhost:4000
2. **GitHub Deployment**: Push changes to GitHub for automatic Pages deployment
3. **Live Validation**: Use web search tool to inspect and validate changes on production URL
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Based on live site inspection, make further improvements

## Assistant Guidelines
- Always use the web search tool to inspect the live site at https://jordanlochhill.github.io/prosody.com.au/ when validating design changes
- Compare local changes with live deployment to ensure they're properly reflected
- Provide specific feedback based on what's visible on the live site
- Help troubleshoot deployment issues if local and live sites don't match
- Use the live site as the "shared canvas" for design critique and improvements

## Typography & Design Standards
- Follow the unified design system in css/main.scss
- Ensure all changes are reflected in both local and live environments
- Validate typography improvements using the live site inspection
- Maintain consistency between development and production environments
