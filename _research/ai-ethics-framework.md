# Introduction

The integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare presents unprecedented opportunities for improving patient outcomes, but also raises significant ethical concerns that must be carefully addressed...

## Ethical Principles

### 1. Patient Autonomy
Patients must retain meaningful control over their healthcare decisions, even when AI systems are involved in the diagnostic or treatment process.

### 2. Beneficence and Non-maleficence
AI systems must be designed to maximize patient benefit while minimizing potential harm through robust testing and validation procedures.

### 3. Justice and Fairness
Healthcare AI must be accessible to all patient populations and must not perpetuate or amplify existing healthcare disparities.

## Framework Implementation

Our proposed framework consists of five key components:

1. **Pre-deployment Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of AI systems before clinical use
2. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of AI performance and outcomes
3. **Transparency Requirements**: Clear communication about AI involvement in patient care
4. **Human Oversight**: Maintaining meaningful human control in critical decisions
5. **Patient Rights**: Protecting patient autonomy and informed consent

## Conclusion

The ethical deployment of AI in healthcare requires a structured, comprehensive approach that prioritizes patient welfare while enabling the benefits of technological advancement.
