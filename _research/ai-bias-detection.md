# Introduction

As large language models become increasingly deployed in real-world applications, the need for robust bias detection methods has become critical.

## Methodology

Our framework consists of three main components for detecting bias in LLM outputs.

## Results

All tested models exhibited some form of bias across multiple demographic dimensions, with bias severity varying significantly across different task types.

## Conclusion

Automated bias detection is essential for responsible AI deployment. Our framework provides a practical tool for identifying and quantifying bias in large language models.
