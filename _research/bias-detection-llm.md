# Abstract

We present novel methods for automatically detecting and quantifying bias in large language models. Our approach combines statistical analysis with interpretability techniques to identify problematic patterns across multiple dimensions of bias, providing actionable insights for model developers and deployers. Through extensive evaluation on diverse LLM architectures, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in uncovering both explicit and subtle forms of bias.

## Introduction

As large language models become increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring fairness and minimizing bias has become a critical concern...
