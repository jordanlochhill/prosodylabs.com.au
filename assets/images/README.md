# Image Management for Prosody Labs

This directory contains all images used throughout the Prosody Labs website, organized by content type and use case.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

```
assets/images/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ heroes/          # Brand and hero imagery
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ courses/         # Educational and learning imagery  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/        # Technology and development imagery
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ insights/        # Communication and content imagery
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research/        # Scientific and academic imagery
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ general/         # Inspirational and collaborative imagery
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ publications/    # Academic publication imagery
```

## üéØ Collection Images

### Adding Images to Collection Items

To add an image to any collection item (courses, projects, insights, research), simply add an `image` field to the front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Item Title"
image: "/assets/images/site/your-image.jpg"
# ... other fields
---
```

### Image Naming Convention

Images should be named descriptively based on their visual content:
- ‚úÖ `books-standing-row.jpg` (describes what's in the image)
- ‚úÖ `scientist-blue-liquid-lab.jpg` (describes the scene)
- ‚ùå `course-hero.jpg` (describes intended use, not content)

### Fallback System

If no `image` field is provided, the system automatically displays attractive colored boxes with relevant icons:

- **Courses**: Blue gradient with graduation cap icon
- **Projects**: Green gradient with cogs icon  
- **Insights**: Purple gradient with lightbulb icon
- **Research**: Orange gradient with flask icon

This ensures visual consistency even when images aren't available yet.

## üé® Visual Strategy

Our image strategy emphasizes:

1. **Content Relevance**: Each image semantically matches its section's purpose
2. **Visual Consistency**: Professional, high-quality imagery throughout
3. **Emotional Resonance**: Images support narrative and brand story
4. **Technical Quality**: Optimized images with proper aspect ratios

## üìê Technical Specifications

- **Recommended Size**: 800x600px minimum for detailed sections
- **Aspect Ratio**: 4:3 or 16:10 preferred
- **Format**: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
- **File Size**: Aim for <500KB for web optimization
- **Quality**: High resolution but web-optimized

## üîÑ Updating Images

1. Add new images to the appropriate category folder
2. Use descriptive filenames based on visual content
3. Update collection item front matter with `image: "/assets/images/site/filename.jpg"`
4. Test both desktop and mobile layouts
5. Verify fallback behavior when image is not specified

## üéØ Status Badge Colors

Collection items can display status badges with automatic color coding:

- **Active/Live**: Green gradient
- **Development**: Orange gradient  
- **Beta Testing**: Purple gradient
- **Enrolling**: Green gradient

Simply add a `status` field to the collection item front matter.

This system ensures that your content always looks professional, whether or not specific images have been added to each item.
